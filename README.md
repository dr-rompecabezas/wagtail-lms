        # ...
        'wagtail_lms',
        # ...
    ]
    ```

2. Add wagtail-lms URLs to your `urls.py`:

    ```python
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [

        path('lms/', include('wagtail_lms.urls')),
        # ...
    ]
    ```

3. Run migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate wagtail_lms
    ```

4. Collect static files:

    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

## Configuration

Optional settings in your Django settings:

```python
# SCORM
WAGTAIL_LMS_SCORM_UPLOAD_PATH = 'scorm_packages/'  # Upload directory
WAGTAIL_LMS_SCORM_CONTENT_PATH = 'scorm_content/'        # Extracted content
WAGTAIL_LMS_AUTO_ENROLL = False                     # Auto-enroll on course visit

# H5P
WAGTAIL_LMS_H5P_UPLOAD_PATH = 'h5p_packages/'      # Upload directory
WAGTAIL_LMS_H5P_CONTENT_PATH = 'h5p_content/'      # Extracted content

# Cache-Control rules for served assets (exact MIME, wildcard, and default)
WAGTAIL_LMS_CACHE_CONTROL = {
    "text/html": "no-cache",
    "text/css": "max-age=86400",
    "application/javascript": "max-age=86400",
    "text/javascript": "max-age=86400",
    "image/*": "max-age=604800",
    "font/*": "max-age=604800",
    "default": "max-age=86400",
}

# Redirect audio/video assets to storage URLs (useful for S3 backends)
WAGTAIL_LMS_REDIRECT_MEDIA = False
```

## Usage

### SCORM Courses

1. Log into Wagtail admin
2. Create a new **Course Page** under Pages
3. Upload a SCORM package via **LMS → SCORM Packages** in the Wagtail admin
4. Assign the SCORM package to your course page and publish

**SCORM package requirements:**

- Valid SCORM 1.2 or 2004 ZIP file
- Must contain `imsmanifest.xml` at the root
- Launch file must be specified in the manifest

### H5P Lessons

H5P activities are composed into long-scroll **Lesson Pages** alongside rich text. A lesson is always a child of a Course Page; enrollment in the course is required to access its lessons.

1. Upload an **H5P Activity** snippet via **LMS → H5P Activities** in the Wagtail admin
2. Create a **Course Page** (no SCORM package required for H5P-only courses)
3. Add a **Lesson Page** as a child of the Course Page
4. In the lesson body, add **H5P Activity** blocks (and/or rich text blocks) to compose the lesson
5. Publish — enrolled learners can access the lesson; xAPI statements are recorded automatically

**H5P package requirements:**

- Valid `.h5p` file (ZIP with an `.h5p` extension) containing `h5p.json` at the root
- **Must include library JavaScript files** — h5p-standalone renders content using
  library JS bundled inside the package (e.g. `H5P.InteractiveVideo-1.27/`).
  A warning is logged and "Could not load activity." is shown if files are missing.

  - ✅ [Lumi desktop editor](https://lumi.education) (free, open-source) — recommended
  - ✅ Moodle / WordPress / Drupal H5P plugin export
  - ✅ Lumi Cloud (free tier available at lumi.education)
  - ❌ H5P.org "Reuse" download — content-only, no library files included
  - ❌ H5P.org does not offer a download-with-libraries option for any content

### Customizing Templates

The package includes minimal, functional styling that works out of the box. To match your project's design:

- **Quick:** Override the CSS classes in your own stylesheet
- **Full control:** Override the templates in your project (standard Django approach)
- **Examples:** See [Template Customization Guide](https://github.com/dr-rompecabezas/wagtail-lms/blob/main/docs/template_customization.md) for Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Bulma examples

For API-first projects, the templates are optional and can be ignored entirely.

## Development

An example project is available in `example_project/` for local development and testing. See its [README](https://github.com/dr-rompecabezas/wagtail-lms/blob/main/example_project/README.md) for setup instructions.

### Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test suite. See [current coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/dr-rompecabezas/wagtail-lms).

```bash
# Install testing dependencies (pytest, pytest-django, pytest-cov)
uv sync --extra testing

# Run all tests
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest

# Run with coverage report
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest --cov=src/wagtail_lms --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/test_models.py -v
```

### Database Considerations

**SQLite**: The package includes retry logic with exponential backoff to handle database lock errors during concurrent SCORM API operations. For development with the example project:

```python
# example_project/settings.py
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": "db.sqlite3",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "timeout": 20,  # Increased timeout for SCORM operations
        },
    }
}
```

**Production**: For production deployments, PostgreSQL is recommended for better concurrency handling:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "wagtail_lms",
        # ... other PostgreSQL settings
    }
}
```
