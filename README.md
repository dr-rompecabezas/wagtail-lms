See `example_project/README.md` for setup instructions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wagtail-lms
```

## Quick Start

1. Add to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django settings:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'wagtail_lms',
        # ...
    ]
    ```

2. Add wagtail-lms URLs to your `urls.py`:

    ```python
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        path('lms/', include('wagtail_lms.urls')),
        # ...
    ]
    ```

3. Run migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate wagtail_lms
    ```

4. Collect static files:

    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

## Configuration

Optional settings in your Django settings:

```python
# SCORM package upload directory
WAGTAIL_LMS_SCORM_UPLOAD_PATH = 'scorm_packages/'

# Extracted SCORM content directory
WAGTAIL_LMS_CONTENT_PATH = 'scorm_content/'

# Auto-enroll users when they visit a course
WAGTAIL_LMS_AUTO_ENROLL = False
```

## Usage

### Creating a Course

1. Log into Wagtail admin
2. Create a new "Course Page" under Pages
3. Upload a SCORM package via Django Admin ‚Üí SCORM Packages
4. Assign the SCORM package to your course page

### SCORM Package Requirements

- Must be a valid SCORM 1.2 or 2004 ZIP file
- Must contain `imsmanifest.xml` at the root
- Launch file must be specified in the manifest

## Development

### Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with 86% code coverage.

```bash
# Install testing dependencies (pytest, pytest-django, pytest-cov)
uv sync --extra testing

# Run all tests
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest

# Run with coverage report
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest --cov=src/wagtail_lms --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/test_models.py -v
```

### Database Considerations

**SQLite**: The package includes retry logic with exponential backoff to handle database lock errors during concurrent SCORM API operations. For development with the example project:

```python
# example_project/settings.py
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": "db.sqlite3",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "timeout": 20,  # Increased timeout for SCORM operations
        },
    }
}
```

**Production**: For production deployments, PostgreSQL is recommended for better concurrency handling:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "wagtail_lms",
        # ... other PostgreSQL settings
    }
}
```
