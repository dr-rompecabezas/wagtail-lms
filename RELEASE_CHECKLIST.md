## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work In Progress

### Example Project

- [x] Basic structure created
- [x] Settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI configured
- [x] Home and search apps created
- [x] Templates and base.html created
- [x] README with setup instructions
- [ ] **NEEDS DEBUGGING** - Project not fully functional yet
  - Multiple runtime issues discovered
  - Requires testing of full workflow
  - See `example_project/README.md` for details

## üöß Before Release

### Must Do

- [ ] Debug and test example_project completely
- [ ] Test full workflow:
  - [ ] Install package: `pip install -e .`
  - [ ] Run example project
  - [ ] Upload actual SCORM package
  - [ ] Create course page
  - [ ] Test enrollment
  - [ ] Test SCORM player
  - [ ] Verify SCORM API works
- [ ] Test package installation in fresh virtualenv
- [ ] Verify all URLs work correctly
- [ ] Test on actual SCORM content

### Should Do

- [ ] Add basic unit tests (even if minimal)
- [ ] Test installation from built package (not just -e)
- [ ] Create sample SCORM package for testing

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Screenshots for documentation
- [ ] Video walkthrough
- [ ] More comprehensive tests

## üìã Known Issues

1. **Example Project** - Needs debugging before it's fully functional
2. **No Tests** - Package has minimal test coverage
3. **Single Version** - Only tested on Python 3.13/Django 5.2.3/Wagtail 7.0.1
4. **Django Admin Required** - Not pure Wagtail (planned for v0.2.0)

## üéØ Decision Point

### Option A: Release Now (Not Recommended)

- Reserve PyPI name
- Mark as alpha with clear warnings
- Accept that example project is broken
- **Risk**: Poor first impression

### Option B: Debug First (Recommended)

- Get example project working
- Test full workflow with real SCORM
- Release with confidence
- **Timeline**: Additional 2-4 hours of work

## üìù Notes for Next Session

When debugging example_project, start with:

1. Fresh database setup following README
2. Create superuser
3. Set up HomePage via admin
4. Upload SCORM package via Django admin
5. Create Course Page via Wagtail admin
6. Test enrollment and player

Focus on making the happy path work, then document any workarounds needed.
