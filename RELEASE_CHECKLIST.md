## ðŸš§ Before PyPI Release

### Must Do

- [ ] Create release tag (v0.1.0)
- [ ] Test package installation in fresh virtualenv
- [ ] Test installation from built wheel: `uv build && pip install dist/wagtail_lms-0.1.0-*.whl`
- [ ] Verify package metadata on test.pypi.org
- [ ] Final review of README and CHANGELOG

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Screenshots for documentation
- [ ] Video walkthrough
- [ ] Sample SCORM packages in repository

## ðŸ“‹ Known Limitations (Documented)

1. **Single Version Tested** - Only verified on Python 3.13/Django 5.2.3/Wagtail 7.0.1
   - Other versions may work but are untested
   - Multi-version testing planned for v0.2.0
2. **Django Admin Required** - SCORM package upload requires Django admin
   - Pure Wagtail interface planned for v0.2.0
3. **SQLite Concurrency** - Database locks possible under heavy load
   - Retry logic implemented with exponential backoff
   - PostgreSQL recommended for production
4. **No CI/CD** - Manual testing required before commits
   - GitHub Actions pipeline planned for v0.2.0

## âœ… Ready for Release

**Status**: Package is production-ready for alpha release

- âœ… Core functionality complete and tested
- âœ… Example project fully functional
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (86% coverage)
- âœ… Documentation complete
- âœ… Bug fixes implemented and tested
- âœ… All workflows verified with real SCORM content

**Release Confidence**: HIGH

The package has been thoroughly tested and debugged. All major workflows work correctly:
